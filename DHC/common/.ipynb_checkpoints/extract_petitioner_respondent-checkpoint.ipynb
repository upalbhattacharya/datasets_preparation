When they\\n\\nwere present near Imperial Cinema, SI Sultan Singh Meena received a\\n\\nsecret information that an individual would come from DBG Road side\\n\\nwith heavy quantity of Charas. This information was recorded as Ex.PW-\\n\\n6/A and sent to SHO through Const.Jawahar Singh. PW-9 (SI Sultan\\n\\nSingh Meena) deposed that thereafter, he requested four or five persons to\\n\\njoin the raiding party. One Puran Chand volunteered to join the\\n\\ninvestigation. At around 07.25 A.M. on the pointing out of the secret\\n\\ninformer, the appellant carrying a polythene bag was asked to stop. In the\\n\\nmeantime, Const.Jawahar Singh handed over to him the copy of DD entry\\n\\n(Ex.PW-9/B) about the directions by the SHO to carry on the\\n\\ninvestigation. The appellant was informed about the information about\\n\\nCharas in his possession. He was further informed that he had legal right\\n\\nto call any Gazetted Officer or Magistrate for the purpose of search.\\n\\nNotice (Ex.PW-3/A) under\\n \\n  Section 50\\n \\n of NDPS Act was prepared. Its\\n\\ncontents were explained to the accused who put his thumb impression at\\n\\npoint 'Q' on Ex.PW-3/A. He refused to call any Magistrate and also\\n\\nrefused to take search of the police party.

Further case of the prosecution is\\n\\nthat thereafter, on search of the bag in the right hand of the accused, five\\n\\npackets were found. Each packet contained two strips of Charas. On\\n\\nweighing, each strip was found containing 250 grams of Charas. The total\\n\\nrecovery of Charas was 2.5 Kg. 10 grams were taken from each strip as\\n\\nsample. FSL form was filled up.

In the cross-examination, the\\n\\nwitness revealed that he remained at the spot till 10.00 A.M. He denied\\n\\nthe suggestion that the appellant was falsely implicated in this case and\\n\\nnothing was recovered from his possession. Apparently, the material facts\\n\\nstated by the crucial witness remained unchallenged in the cross-\\n\\nexamination. Nothing was suggested to the witness if there was non-\\n\\ncompliance of\\n \\n  Sections 42\\n \\n ,\\n \\n  50\\n \\n and\\n \\n  57\\n \\n of NDPS Act.

JUSTICE RAJIV SAHAI ENDLAW\\n\\n1.      Whether reporters of Local papers may\\n        be allowed to see the judgment?                 Yes\\n\\n2.      To be referred to the reporter or not?          Yes\\n\\n3.      Whether the judgment should be reported                 Yes\\n        in the Digest?\\n\\n\\nRAJIV SAHAI ENDLAW, J.\\n\\n 1.      All the six petitions have been preferred invoking the jurisdiction of this court\\nunder\\n \\n  Article 227\\n \\n of the Constitution of India with respect to the order of the first\\nappellate court on an application under Order 41Rule 27 of the CPC. In all the cases, the\\napplication under Order 41Rule 27 of the CPC was disposed of by the first appellate\\ncourt before taking up the appeal for hearing, leading to the grievance being made with\\nrespect thereto before this court as aforesaid, even while the appeals in each of the cases\\nare still pending for consideration before the first appellate court. This court being prima\\nfacie of the view that a challenge to the decision, if any, on an application under Order 41\\nRule 27 of the CPC taken up prior to the hearing of the appeal, is not entertainable before\\nthis court, put the said question to the counsels as and when each of the said matters\\ncame up before this court. Attention of the counsels was also drawn by this court to the\\njudgments of the Supreme Court in Gurdev Singh Vs. Mehnga Ram AIR 1997 SC 3572\\nand in Mahavir Singh Vs. Naresh Chandra (2001) 1 SCC 309. The common questions\\nas to the very maintainability of the petition being involved in all matters, the same were\\ntaken up for hearing together, only qua the question of maintainability and the counsels\\nin all the matters have been heard on that aspect.\\n\\n 2.      The Supreme Court in Gurdev Singh(supra) was concerned with the order made\\nby the High Court in exercise of its revisional jurisdiction under Section 115 of the CPC\\nand the order of the first appellate court on an application under Order 41 Rule 27 of the\\nCPC made before the hearing of the appeal. The Supreme Court held as under:-\\n\\n 3.   In Mahavir Singh (supra) also the order of the High Court in the exercise of\\nrevisional jurisdiction, setting aside the order of the first appellate court dismissing the\\napplication under Order 41 Rule 27 of the CPC and allowing the said application while\\nthe appeal was still pending before the first appellate court was for consideration. The\\nSupreme Court held\\n\\n         \"Therefore, when the first appellate court did not find the necessity to\\n         allow the application, we fail to understand as to how the High Court\\n         could, in exercise of its power under Section 115 of the CPC, have\\n         interfered with such an order, particularly when the whole appeal is not\\n         before the court. It is only in the circumstances when the appellate court\\n         requires such evidence to pronounce the judgment the necessity to\\n         adduce additional evidence would arise and not in any other\\n         circumstance. When the first appellate court passed the order on the\\n         application filed under Order 41Rule 27 of the CPC, the whole appeal\\n         was before it and if the first appellate is satisfied that additional evidence\\n         was not required, we fail to understand as to how the High Court could\\n \\n  CM No.331/2007, 550/2007, 1296/2009, 1301/2009, 1309/2009, 1401/2009              Page 4 of 12\\n \\n interfere with such an order under Section 115 of the CPC. In this\\n         regard, we may notice the decision of this court in Gurdev Singh Vs.\\n         Mehnga Ram in which the scope of exercise of power under Section 115\\n         of the CPC on an order passed in an application filed under Order\\n         41Rule 27 of the CPC was considered. When this decision was cited\\n         before the High Court, the same was brushed aside by stating that the\\n         principles stated therein is not applicable to the facts of the case. We do\\n         not think so. The High Court ought not to have interfered with such an\\n         order.\"\\n'}\n",

Appellant\\n\\nhas deposited the costs of Rs.2,000/- with the Delhi High Court Legal\\n\\nServices Committee and receipt of which shall be placed on record during\\n\\nthe course of the day. Appeal is therefore restored to its original number.\\n\\n\\n      Applications are disposed of.\\nFAO 468/2012                                                Page 1 of 3\\n FAO 468/2012\\n\\n1.    This appeal is filed under Section 23 of the Railway Claims Tribunal\\n\\nAct, 1987 impugning the judgment of the Tribunal dated 11.04.2012 by\\n\\nwhich the Tribunal has refused to condone the delay of 227 days in filing the\\n\\nclaim petition.\\n\\n\\n2.    It is not disputed that there is power in the Tribunal to condone the\\n\\ndelay and the issue is whether sufficient cause is shown for condonation of\\n\\ndelay of 227 days.\\n\\n\\n3.    In my opinion, delay of 227 days is not such a great delay because\\n\\nordinarily a period of three years is provided for filing of all types of\\n\\nresiduary suits under the Limitation Act. The claim petition before the\\n\\nTribunal is however to be filed within one year. The Supreme Court in the\\n\\ncase of N. Balakrishnan Vs. M. Krishnamurthy AIR 1998 SC 3222 has\\n\\nheld that once condonation of delay is sought there is bound to be some\\n\\nnegligence but once there is no want of good faith on behalf of the applicant\\n\\ndelay should be condoned.\\n\\n\\n4.    No doubt in the present case appellant in the application for\\n\\ncondonation of delay has not mentioned the name of the earlier counsel\\n\\n\\nFAO 468/2012                                               Page 2 of 3\\n who has expired and consequently leading to delay in filing the claim\\n\\npetition, however, such deficiency has been removed by stating the details in\\n\\nthis appeal. It may be noted that the appellant is a permanent resident of\\n\\nKanpur and, therefore, could not remain personally in touch with his earlier\\n\\ncounsel who expired, and therefore the delay of 227 days.\\n\\n\\n5.    In view of the above, this is a fit case where the Tribunal should\\n\\nentertain the claim petition on merits instead of dismissing the claim petition\\n\\non technicalities, more so because sufficient reasons have been given of the\\n\\npapers being given to the earlier counsel who has died.\\n\\n\\n6.    In view of the above, the appeal is allowed. Impugned judgment of\\n\\nthe Tribunal dated 11.04.2012 is set aside. Delay in filing the claim petition\\n\\nis condoned. The Railway Claims Tribunal will now decide the matter on\\n\\nmerits in accordance with law.\\n\\n\\n7.

The assessee, a contractor undertaking projects of Indian Railways\\n\\non turn key basis, filed its return of income for the assessment year 1995-\\n\\n96 on 29.11.1995 declaring a total income of Rs.88,91,700/-. On the\\n\\nbasis of the materials gathered by the income tax authorities in the course\\n\\nof a search carried out in the assessee\\'s premises on 14.03.1995 as well as\\n\\nin the premises of the directors and trusted persons, the assessing officer\\n\\nreferred the matter to a special audit in terms of\\n \\n  Section 142(2A)\\n \\n of the\\n\\nAct. The special audit report, inter alia, reported that there were large\\n\\nnumber of transactions for which no supporting vouchers were available,\\n\\nthat several discrepancies in cash and journal vouchers and changes in the\\n\\ndates of the vouchers were noticed, that there were discrepancies in the\\n\\nadjustments of cash books with cash vouchers, that there were payments\\n\\nmade to the Railway staff which were not allowable as deduction under\\n\\nthe Act, that several payments were made without obtaining any signature\\n\\nof the recipients, that the assessee did not maintain any stock register and\\n\\ndid not disclose any work-in-progress in the balance sheet, that several\\n\\nitems of capital expenditure were passed off as revenue expenditure and\\n\\nso on and so forth. In response to the queries raised by the assessing\\n\\nofficer on the basis of special audit report the assessee could not give any\\n\\nproper explanation and wherever an explanation was sought to be given,\\n\\nit was found to be evasive. The assessee was also allowed inspection of\\n \\n  ITA No.244/2013                                            Page 2 of 12\\n \\n the seized documents and was supplied photocopies of the seized records.\\n\\nDespite such opportunity, no convincing reason was given by the\\n\\nassessee to the query of the assessing officer as to why the results\\n\\ndeclared by the books of accounts could not be rejected and the profit\\n\\nfrom the contracts be not estimated at a rate exceeding 11% of the gross\\n\\nreceipts. Not convinced by the assessee\\'s explanation to the show-cause\\n\\nnotice, which was only that the accounts maintained by the assessee were\\n\\nbased on accounting policies consistently adhered to, the assessing officer\\n\\nproceeded to estimate the net profit of the assessee at 11% of the gross\\n\\nreceipts from the contracts amounting to Rs.20,30,74,024/-, which came\\n\\nto Rs.2,23,38,143/-. The assessing officer also found that some income\\n\\nfrom business activities was not included in the aforesaid receipts and the\\n\\nprofit from such activity was taken at Rs.13,34,308/-. The total business\\n\\nincome was thus taken at Rs.2,36,72,451/- before allowing depreciation.\\n\\nDemands were accordingly raised.\\n\\n'}\n",

It is submitted that the I.O., SI Badruddin Khan\\n\\n     has clearly deposed that neither the revolver was recovered nor\\n\\n     empty shell of the cartridge of the bullets fired were recovered.\\n\\n     The blood stained clothes were also not seized and, thus, no\\n \\n  CRL.A.NO.63-2001                                       Page 2 of 27\\n \\n reliance can be placed on the story of the prosecution.

It is further contended that the Sessions Court has failed to\\n\\n     appreciate the fact that PW-1, injured, had clearly admitted in his\\n\\n     statement that he was conscious and in a shock for about 45\\n\\n     minutes after the incident, whereas his statement was recorded\\n\\n     by the police on 02.01.2005.   The delay would lead to show that\\n\\n     the whole story has been concocted by the prosecution in\\n\\n     collusion with the injured to falsely implicate the appellant in a\\n\\n     criminal case. It is also submitted that a police post was\\n\\n     approximately 100 yards away from the place of alleged incident\\n\\n     and in case the injured was conscious for 45 minutes after the\\n\\n     alleged incident, there was no reason to record the statement of\\n\\n     PW-5 and the statement of PW-1 (victim) should have been\\n\\n     recorded to register the FIR. It is submitted that the statement of\\n\\n     the injured should have been recorded at the time of his\\n\\n     admission in the hospital by the I.O. Further since the injured has\\n\\n     categorically deposed that Lala Ram, Bachu Singh, Raju and\\n\\n     Rakesh were present at the spot, there was no reason for the I.O.\\n\\n     to only record the statement of PW-5, Rakesh Kumar. Counsel for\\n\\n     the appellane further submits that even the Doctor, PW-7,\\n\\n     deposed that he never opined with respect to the nature of\\n \\n  CRL.A.NO.63-2001                                       Page 3 of 27\\n \\n injuries, the presence or absence of the bullet in the body of the\\n\\n     injured.\\n'}\n",

Abdul Qayum and Shamshad were also convicted\\nfor the offence punishable under\\n \\n  Section 412\\n \\n IPC. Vide order on sentence\\ndated 5th September, 2014, all the appellants were sentenced to undergo\\nrigorous imprisonment for a period of seven years and to pay a fine of\\n`10,000/- for offence punishable under\\n \\n  Section 395\\n \\n IPC and rigorous\\nimprisonment for period of seven years and to pay a fine of `5,000/- for\\noffence punishable under\\n \\n  Section 120B\\n \\n IPC.

Learned counsel for appellant Mehboob contends that one co-accused\\nBashir Ahmed allegedly involved in the incident was never arrested nor\\ntried, hence conviction of the appellant for offence punishable under Section\\n \\n  CRL.A. 150/2015 & Ors.                                          Page 2 of 15\\n \\n 395\\n \\n  IPC\\n \\n i.e. dacoity is liable to be set aside.   Appellant Mehboob has not\\nbeen convicted for offence punishable under\\n \\n  Section 412\\n \\n IPC hence it can\\nsafely be held that the prosecution has not proved his involvement in the\\ndacoity as well. No recovery was made pursuant to the arrest of Mehboob.\\nHe has been falsely implicated.\\n\\n 3.     Learned counsel for Shamshad contends that an alleged offence\\npunishable under\\n \\n  Section 356\\n \\n IPC has been converted into offence\\npunishable under\\n \\n  Section 395\\n \\n read with\\n \\n  Section 120B\\n \\n IPC by roping in\\nMohd. Abdul Qayum who was only plying the rickshaw, as a conspirator to\\ntake the number of accused persons to five. In the FIR, complainant stated\\nthat chain of the rickshaw was getting disengaged frequently, so he asked\\nthem to take the tonga. However Nand Lal, the complainant improved his\\nversion in Court to show the complicity of Mohd. Qayum and stated that he\\nforcefully kept their bags in the Tonga. Neither rickshaw of Mohd. Qayum\\nwas recovered nor the same was sent for mechanical inspection. In the FIR,\\nit was not stated that threat of giving knife blow was made however the same\\nwas deposed to in Court.    Though from Ajmeri Gate, the complainant and\\nhis brother were to go to Sarafa Bazar, Chandni Chowk, one fails to\\nunderstand how they landed up in front of Hanuman Mandir, Jamuna Bazar.\\nNo description of the accused has been mentioned in the FIR.      As per the\\nnotes in the site plan, four persons were involved. No previous involvement\\nof the appellant has been proved. Thus even if the case of the prosecution is\\naccepted, at best the appellants can be convicted for offence punishable\\nunder\\n \\n  Section 356\\n \\n IPC or 392\\n \\n  IPC\\n \\n and they be thus released on the period\\nalready undergone.
